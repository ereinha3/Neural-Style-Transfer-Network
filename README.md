This project was created as part of a summer course on Deep Learning Neural Networks.
The inspiration for this project was a result of my love for art and curiosity regarding original art creation using Generative
Adversarial Networks. The results were not as accurate as I had hoped but still proved interesting. Further description regarding the 
project and use of various functions and network architecture can be found [here](https://medium.com/@ethanreinhart/creating-abstract-art-using-neural-style-transfer-of-lymph-node-sections-with-cyclegan-46a3d19e5731) in a summarizing article created by me.
